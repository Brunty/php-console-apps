# Building console applications in PHP

You can use the included Vagrant configuration to provision a box that includes PHP 7.1, MySQL and composer ready to go.

## To get up and running:

1. Clone this repo and run `vagrant up` in the directory you clone it into.
2. Copy `.env.dist` into `.env`
3. `vagrant ssh` into the machine
4. `cd /app` to get to the directory we'll be working in
5. `composer install` to install the required dependencies for the workshop

It'll be useful to re-pull from the repository and re-provision Vagrant the day before the workshop 

## Turn up, learn and enjoy!
